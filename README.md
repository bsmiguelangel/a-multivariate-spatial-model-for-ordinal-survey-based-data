`R` code used to run the entire case study. The implementation is provided using the `NIMBLE` Bayesian inference MCMC package. The result files from the models are not provided, as they exceed 25MB.

**Note**: Due to the individual nature of the data set used, we are not allowed to share it. However, data providers should allow access to the data set under the same conditions as the authors of this study.
